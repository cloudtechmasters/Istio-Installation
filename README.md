# Step1: DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL ISTIO CLI
Before we can get started configuring Istio weâ€™ll need to first install the command line tools that you will interact with. To do this run the following.
  
    echo 'export ISTIO_VERSION="1.5.2"' >> ${HOME}/.bash_profile
    source ${HOME}/.bash_profile
    mkdir environment
    cd ~/environment
    curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
The installation directory contains:
*Installation YAML files for Kubernetes in install/kubernetes
*Sample applications in samples/
*The istioctl client binary in the bin/ directory (istioctl is used when manually injecting Envoy as a sidecar proxy).

    cd ${HOME}/environment/istio-${ISTIO_VERSION}
    sudo cp -v bin/istioctl /usr/bin/
We can verify that we have the proper version in our $PATH
    
    istioctl version --remote=false
# INSTALL ISTIO
Istio will be installed in the istio-system namespace.
    
    istioctl manifest apply --set profile=demo
We can verify all the services have been installed.

    kubectl -n istio-system get svc
and check the corresponding pods with

    kubectl -n istio-system get pods
